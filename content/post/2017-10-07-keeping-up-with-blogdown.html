<p><em>Updated: 2018-05-19</em></p>
<p>I’ve loved <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> 📦 for so long, that I was kind of shocked 😱 when I saw <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yinui Xie</a>’s post, <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/"><strong>Announcing blogdown: Create Websites with R Markdown</strong></a>, on the <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/">RStudio blog</a> just <em>last month</em>!</p>
<p>Have people really been living without the magic ✨ of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, <em>yes</em>, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun 👯.</p>
<div id="blogdown-the-definitive-guide" class="section level2">
<h2><code>blogdown</code>: the definitive guide 📖</h2>
<p>Obviously I dig all the resources that will ensue, but I’d be remiss were I <em>not</em> to point out that the bookdown book, <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><strong><em>blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</em></strong></a> by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill, is where it’s at 🙌.</p>

<p>In addition to covering the how-to from start to finish, it’s constantly being updated (last was 📅 2018-02-12, as of this writing)– so, it’s a real go-to!</p>
<p>They’ve also added a minimal <a href="https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/about/">blogdown demo site</a>, which is <em>incredibly</em> helpful if you’re just getting set up.</p>

<h2>Fin…for now 😬</h2>
<p>There are a <em>ton</em> of blogdown resources out there, many of which I haven’t covered here (especially when it comes to moving from a specific platform <em>to</em> blogdown, which could be a category unto itself). As always, tweet me (<a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">@dataandme</a>) 🐦, or comment if you have questions and/or suggestions. Perhaps a second roundup will be in store for blogdown.</p>
