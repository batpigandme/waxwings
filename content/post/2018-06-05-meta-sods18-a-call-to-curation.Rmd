`r emo::ji("sunglasses")` Summer of Data Science ([`#SoDS18`](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoDS18?src=hash)) 
is upon us, and (thanks to Renée (aka 
[\@BecomingDataSci](https://twitter.com/becomingdatasci))) there is already
some [great guidance](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/) out there. I'm a big fan of “mini”
projects — and, unlike Highlander, I'm pretty sure _there can only be one_
isn't the name of the `SoDS` game.

So, I wanted to share some ideas I have for potential micro-projects...

## `r emo::ji_glue(":raised_hands:")` do something by hand

I know, I know — this borders on heresy. As my [Archer visualization](http://archervisualization.herokuapp.com/) 
partner-in-crime, [Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks), put it:[^1]

> Whenever you tell someone you painstakingly annotated something by hand they
> grimace and get uncomfortable like you told them you enjoy thrash metal.

But, according to expert educators (Albert Y. Kim and Chester Ismay, to be
specific), there's still a lot of value in taking ye olde approach to things.

```

### `r emo::ji("package")` Compare/recommend packages

First off, I want to acknowledge that there have been some great
algorithmic/technical approaches to this, and there are projects under way
(`r emo::ji("dolphin")` give [`flipper`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/flipper) 
a look when you have a chance).[^3] In fact, I recommend you make use of these 
approaches should you give it a go (detailed nicely in [_packagemetrics
- Helping you choose a package since runconf17_](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/27/packagemetrics/)) 
— but give it that certain human _je ne sais quoi_. `r emo::ji("nail")`

This doesn't have to be exhaustive! I really enjoyed two posts by Adam
Medcalf, ["My favourite R package for: summarising data"](https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/my-favourite-r-package-for-summarising-data/) 
and ["R packages for summarising data – part 2"](https://dabblingwithdata.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/r-packages-for-summarising-data-part-2/).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "950453570901565441")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "971385513465794562")
```

This can also be great info to add to a package README or vignette. For example,
[Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) (readxl's maintainer, and all-
around awesome human) discusses similar packages in the [readxl README](https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl). 
This is a win-win, since she'll point users who file issues to a _different_ 
Excel-related package when it's appropriate — as is often the case when it comes to [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl)'s specialty of handling awkward, 
non-tabular Excel files.[^readxl]

There's no need to leave this up to the maintainers, though. If you go through a
few packages while trying to accomplish a task, _you_ are in a great position to
describe what it was about them that led to your choice!

Recommending packages can also be of great help to others. Check out 
[Sharon Machlis'](https://twitter.com/sharon000) posts for some inspiration in 
that department.

### `r emo::ji("cyclone")` Round-up related resources

I've done this a few times [on my blog](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/tags/roundups/), 
mainly with posts featuring a given package, but there are a lot of different 
angles one could take here. At the recent rOpenSci unconf, one group made a 
package ([mchtoolbox](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/mchtoolbox)) related to
maternal and child health outcomes. Afterwards, they learned about some 
existing, related packages out there they hadn't known about. IMHO, this is a 
good thing — in fact, it was a conversation with 
[Monica Gerber](https://twitter.com/mwgerber) that led me to write this post.

You might think of this as making a sort of micro 
[CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). While it might be
obvious to you that _X_ package can be used for _Y_ task, it can be difficult
to navigate the 12,000+ packages on CRAN (to say nothing of the others on
Bioconductor, GitHub and elsewhere).[^4]

### `r emo::ji("angel")` Bring a dataset to life

`r emo::ji("flower")` How many times have you used the `iris` dataset?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "999579440953937920")
```

`r emo::ji("car")` What about `mtcars`?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1001620339766460423")
```

I can't speak for [Antoine Bichat](https://twitter.com/_abichat)'s experience
with `iris`, but hunting down and sharing pics of the frequently-plotted
’74 vehicles was a pretty eye-opening experience. Among other things, thanks
to the keen eye of [Nathanael Aff](https://twitter.com/nateaff/status/1001635351868260352) 
we found out that the Mazda RX4 and RX4 Wagons have **_rotary engines_**. Even 
if you allow for the cylinder-to-rotor conversion (which is a bit of a stretch), 
it's like comparing apples to oranges (or doritos to a water pump).

```{r echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "4x04M8YwOBw")
```

**Update**: Thanks to Ben Bolker, I can rest knowing that the source paper from which [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) is taken acknowledges this unsettling error.

## `r emo::ji("singer")` And more...

Let the spirit move you! Share your ideas with others (including me, naturally), 
and make it an `#SoDS18` to remember.

[^1]: `r emo::ji("eyes")` you should read the whole piece, [Visualizing Archer: Data visualization to further your enjoyment of narrative](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-archer-bcb80e319625), because it's great...and I'm totally not biased at all.

[^2]: Check out the slides from Albert Kim's talk from Data Day Texas 2018, ["Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue Ways to teach data science (and learn it too!)"](http://rudeboybert.rbind.io/talk/2018-01-27_Data_Day_Texas.pdf).

[^3]: [packagemetrics](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/27/packagemetrics/) and its related [issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/78) from the [rOpenSci 2017 unconf](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/) in will give you a better sense of this problem than I could ever hope to!

[^4]: In fact, there was a whole session about this at useR! 2017, which you can learn more about from Julia Silge's posts, ["How do you discover R packages?"](https://juliasilge.com/blog/package-search/), and ["Seeking guidance in choosing and evaluating R packages"](https://juliasilge.com/blog/package-guidance/).

[^readxl]: These include: [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx), [writexl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=writexla), the C-library [libxlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter), and [tidyxl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyxl).
