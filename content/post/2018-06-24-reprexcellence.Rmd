In honour of the triumphant return of [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) to CRAN, let's revisit what I refer to as [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan)'s keys to **reprex-cellence**.[^notjenny] The three keys are as follows:

 1. code that **actually runs**  
 2. code that **I don't have to run**
 3. code that **can be easily run**[^jenny]
 
## Our example

True to the _ésprit de reprex_, let's look at a real world example to unpack why these attributes are so useful. The code shown comes from an issue filed by [Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke/) in the ggplot2 repo, [Descent heights still not right](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2687). 

To be clear, "code that actually runs" does not mean that your code needs to be error-free. In fact, a reprex is a great way to show exactly what's leading to an error. It just so happens that, in this particular case, the "error" is in what's _produced_ by the code.


Code that actually runs, and that can be easily run is, in essence, *self-contained* and *minimal*. Self-contained means that everything we need (packages, data) is inside of the reprex, and you really can't get much more minimal than a ggplot2 chart that plots but a single point.[^dosdonts] Since the focus of the issue is descent height for the title text, that's the only aspect that changes between the two charts (_13/10 minimal af_).


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(x = 1)
```

```{r text10, fig.retina=2}
ggplot(df, aes(x, x)) + geom_point() +
  ggtitle("gjpjQ") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))
```

```{r text100, fig.retina=2}
ggplot(df, aes(x, x)) + geom_point() +
  ggtitle("gjpjQ") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 100))
```

Because the example is suitably minimal, you don't _need_ to run the code to see the problem.

## Mouse-free reprexing `r emo::ji("mouse")`

If, like me, you're lazy _and_ run a lot of reprexes, you might want to consider making your life easier by using a keyboard shortcut for your reprexing needs. The shortcut can be anything you desire, I'm just demonstrating with the one I happen to use.

![Generate reprex of selection using `Ctrl` + `R` + `P`](https://i.imgur.com/OjzLPtE.gif)

Adding a shortcut of your own is easy as can be. First, you'll need to navigate to `Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...` in the RStudio IDE by way of the `Tools` menu.

![RStudio Tools >> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...](https://i.imgur.com/qhpEmxO.png)

Once you're in the `Keyboard Shortcuts` interface, find the reprex add-in names. (You can do this by searching for "reprex." `r emo::ji("magnifying")`) To add a shortcut, just click in the **Shortcuts** column of your chosen command (in this example, `reprex selection`) and start typing, click **Apply**, and you're good to go.
