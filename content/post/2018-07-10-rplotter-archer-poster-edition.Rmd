Jo-fai Chow's [rPlotter](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter) is described as
"[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners." I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as "another" colour-palette generator for R.[^1] To be specific, I was drawn in by **_Palette Tarantino_**, which you can catch the code for in Chow's post, [Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator](https://blenditbayes.blogspot.com/2014/05/towards-yet-another-r-colour-palette.html).

Being, well, me—my first thought was `r emo::ji("thinking")` _How could I involve Archer in this?_ So, let's Archify things... (Yes, his name's a verb, you'll just have to accept that fact!)

[^1]: Author's words, not mine—I would never disparrage the importance of colour-palette generators.
