description: '📝 Notes from my the 2018 rOpenSci unconf — Seattle edition.'

<p>This year’s <a href="http://unconf18.ropensci.org/">rOpenSci unconf</a> was held in
Seattle, and (after the great time I had at
<a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/06/ceci-n-est-pas-un-conf/">last year’s event</a>),
I was thrilled to be able to go back for more! All the fun, with like 40% less
mind-crippling impostor-syndrome anxiety.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> 😬</p>
<p>Once again, <a href="https://twitter.com/seankross">Sean Kross</a> did a great job of rounding up <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf18-projects/">the projects</a>, complete with emoji annotations. 💥</p>

<p>In order to avoid the month-long delay between attendance and blog post
from last year, I took large(ish) notes during the project presentations.
<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> You can and <em>should</em> visit the project README files for the
details (since after two days of unconferring my note-taking skills were a
little sub-par).</p>

Look at all those happy faces — what more proof could you possibly need of a
job well done? 😄</p>
