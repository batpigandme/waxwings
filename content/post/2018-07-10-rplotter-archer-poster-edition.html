<p>Jo-fai Chow’s <a href="https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter">rPlotter</a> is described as
“[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners.” I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as “another” colour-palette generator for R.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> To be specific, I was drawn in by <strong><em>Palette Tarantino</em></strong>, which you can catch the code for in Chow’s post, <a href="https://blenditbayes.blogspot.com/2014/05/towards-yet-another-r-colour-palette.html">Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator</a>.</p>

<p>Being, well, me—my first thought was 🤔 <em>How could I involve Archer in this?</em> So, let’s Archify things… (Yes, his name’s a verb, you’ll just have to accept that fact!)</p>
