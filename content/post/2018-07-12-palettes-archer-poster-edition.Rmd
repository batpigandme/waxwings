[Jo-fai Chow](http://www.jofaichow.co.uk/)'s [rPlotter](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter) is described as
"[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners." I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as "another" colour-palette generator for R.[^1] To be specific, I was drawn in by **_Palette Tarantino_**, which you can catch the code for in Chow's post, [Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator](https://blenditbayes.blogspot.com/2014/05/towards-yet-another-r-colour-palette.html).

Being, well, me—my first thought was `r emo::ji("thinking")` _How could I involve Archer in this?_ So, let's Archify things... (Yes, his name's a verb, you'll just have to accept that fact!)

```{r load-lib, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("woobe/rPlotter")
library(rPlotter)
```

### `rPlotter::extract_colours()`

I'll follow the [example](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter#example-extract_colours) from the [rPlotter README](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter) for extracting colours. I retrieved the [Archer posters](https://imgur.com/a/jPE0y95) for each season from the [Archer wiki](http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Seasons) (_duh_), which I'll use as my source images.


Before we get into the season-by-season posters, let's take a peek at what I consider to be the "generic" Archer poster of sorts.

![Archer poster](https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg)

```{r season-1}
pal_a <- extract_colours("https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg", num_col = 8)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
pie(rep(1, 8), col = pal_a, main = "Palette based on Archer Poster")
hist(Nile, breaks = 8, col = pal_a, main = "Palette based on Archer Poster")
```

I'm not loving this palette. I mean, I understand why it's happening—the suit, the background, the fire, but let's take another palette generator for a spin.

### `quickpalette::url_palette()`

Emil Hvitfeldt's [quickpalette](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quickpalette) package "provide[s] a few tools to quickly acquire new color palettes to be used in R." We'll pair it with the [pals](https://github.com/kwstat/pals) package for easy layout generation.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/quickpalette")
library(quickpalette)
library(pals)
```

We'll use the same image, so we can get a "fair" comparison between the packages.

```{r quickpal}
url <- "https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg"
quickpalette::url_palette(url = url, n_clusters = 8) %>%
  pals::pal.bands()
```

Definitely getting a brighter vibe with this one.

### `paletter::create_palette()`

Let's try one more, Andrea Cirillo's [paletter](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter). Unlike the other two, paletter prefers an image path, so I'll use a local copy of the same image. There's a great post describing the math behind the methods in this package, which you can check out [here](https://datascienceplus.com/how-to-use-paletter-to-automagically-build-palettes-from-pictures/).

```{r paletter-lib, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("AndreaCirilloAC/paletter")
library(paletter)
```

You have to specify a `type_of_variable` argument, so I'll go with `"categorical"`.

```{r paletter-pal, cache.lazy=TRUE}
image_path <- here::here("static", "img", "ArcherPosters", "archer-poster.jpg")
colours_vector <- create_palette(image_path = image_path,
                                 number_of_colors = 8, 
                                 type_of_variable = "categorical")
```

Though I like the layout of the output, paletter takes significantly longer than the other two packages. I also don't know why it outputs the palette twice. So...`r emo::ji("shrug")`

### A palette for all seasons

Based on the code chunk above, I'm beginning to suspect that there might be a lot of copying and pasting involved, which means it's probably time for (you guessed it) a function. To make life even easier on myself, I'm going to use local copies of the images, which I've conveniently suffixed with `_season*.jpg`.

I can use a combination of the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) and [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) packages to build paths to the images.

```{r glue-path}
num <- 2
here::here("static", "img", "ArcherPosters", glue::glue("ArcherPromoPoster_season{num}.jpg"))
```


[^1]: Author's words, not mine—I would never disparrage the importance of colour-palette generators.
