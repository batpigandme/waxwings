### Pro tip!

[Alison Presmanes Hill]( https://alison.rbind.io) has been writing a series of posts, each a different "Spoonful of Hugo." If you're building your blog on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), these will make your life much easier in the long run, and are not to be missed! As of today, the topics covered are:

  1. [Archetypes](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/)  
  2. [The `netlify.toml` file](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/)  
  3. [Page bundles](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/)  
  4. [Troubleshooting your build](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-03-04-hugo-troubleshooting/)

## Back to our regularly scheduled programming...

I've loved [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) `r emo::ji_glue(":package:")` for so long, that I was kind of shocked `r emo::ji_glue(":scream:")` when I saw [Yinui Xie](https://yihui.name/)'s post, [**Announcing blogdown: Create Websites with R Markdown**](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/), on the [RStudio blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/) just _last month_!

Have people really been living without the magic `r emo::ji_glue(":sparkles:")` of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, _yes_, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun `r emo::ji_glue(":dancers:")`.

## `blogdown`: the definitive guide `r emo::ji_glue(":book:")`

Obviously I dig all the resources that will ensue, but I'd be remiss were I _not_ to point out that the bookdown book, [**_blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown_**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill, is where it's at `r emo::ji_glue(":raised_hands:")`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "915200318455128065")
```

In addition to covering the how-to from start to finish, it's constantly being updated (last was `r emo::ji_glue(":date:")` 2018-02-12, as of this writing)-- so, it's a real go-to!

They've also added a minimal [blogdown demo site](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/about/), which is _incredibly_ helpful if you're just getting set up.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "968954545715007489")
```

## Fin...for now `r emo::ji_glue(":grimacing:")`

There are a _ton_ of blogdown resources out there, many of which I haven't covered here (especially when it comes to moving from a specific platform _to_ blogdown, which could be a category unto itself). As always, tweet me ([\@dataandme](https://twitter.com/dataandme)) `r emo::ji("bird")`, or comment if you have questions and/or suggestions. Perhaps a second roundup will be in store for blogdown.
