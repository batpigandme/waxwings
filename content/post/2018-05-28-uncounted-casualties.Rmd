There is a relationship between war (and death) and counting things.[^debt]
Some of the best known data visualizations pertain to the casualties of war
(e.g. Florence Nightingale's coxcomb chart, [Diagram of the Causes of Mortality, 1858](http://infowetrust.com/scroll/#nightingale)).

When I came upon Lt. Colonel Albert G. Love's 1931 ["War Casualties"](http://www.gwpda.org/medical/stats/warcasu1.htm)[^love] my curiosity 
was piqued. Focused on "the World War" (at that date there had only 
been one), Colonel Love describes his task in the preface:

> An attempt is made in the following pages to outline a system for estimating, 
> on the basis of our casualty experience in past wars, the requirements for 
> medical service including hospitalization and evacuation of front line 
> casualties; and further to show how intimately the question of replacements 
> for all branches of an army is related to casualty rates, and also to prompt 
> and efficient medical care.

Love's goal is not ignoble, and there's something oddly charming about
visualizations made by hand — annotations and all, which made it (briefly) easy
to ignore the meaning behind the charts.

Take [Figure 56](http://www.gwpda.org/medical/stats/graphs/fig056.gif),
for example: _Loss of manpower from war (poisonous) gases in the Theater of
Operations, during successive months_ (below).

Or [Figure 48](http://www.gwpda.org/medical/stats/graphs/fig048.gif), for
another: _Theater of Operations war gas cases disposed of in the Zone of the
Interior by return to duty, death, or disability discharge when sent to the Zone
of the Interior for further treatment_.

It's particularly striking that the category "disposed of" encompasses: return
to duty, disability discharge, and _death_, which seem like very different
outcomes.

I've chosen "War Gas" examples because of Wilfred Owen's 1921 poem on one such
casualty, [_Dulce et Decorum Est_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46560/dulce-et-decorum-est), 
which has stuck with me ever since we read it in history class when I was 16.

<blockquote>
<strong><em>Dulce et Decorum Est</em></strong>  
<strong>by Wilfred Owen</strong>

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,  
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,  
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,  
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.  
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,  
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;  
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots  
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.


Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling  
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,  
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling  
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—  
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,  
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.  


In all my dreams before my helpless sight,  
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.  


If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace  
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,  
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,  
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;  
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,  
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—  
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  
To children ardent for some desperate glory,  
The old Lie: <em>Dulce et decorum est</em>  
<em>Pro patria mori</em>.  
</blockquote>

Neither the numbers nor their graphical depictions glorify war, but there is
something immeasurable caught in Owen's poem, and the juxtaposition of the two
brought to mind a Stalin aphorism:[^stalin]
