description: '🏀 NBA teams ranked by win percentage over the course of the 2017-18 season/an excuse to tinker with Flourish visualizations.'

<p>Inspired by Laura Ellis (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleMissData">@LittleMissData</a>’s) post, <a href="https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/data-storytelling"><strong>Data Storytelling</strong></a>, I decided to take <a href="https://flourish.studio/"><strong>Flourish</strong></a> for a spin to look at NBA-team win percentages over the course of the season thus far. 🏀</p>
<p>As advertised, Flourish is a tool for <em>“powerful, beautiful, easy data visualisation”</em> that lets you <em>“quickly turn your spreadsheets into stunning online charts, maps and interactive stories.”</em> Clearly someone on the Flourish team and I are on the same wavelength when it comes to carnival games and data visualization, since the animated rank or relative-score chart that caught my eye turned out to be named the <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/story/959/">Horserace template</a>.</p>

<p>The hardest part (which wasn’t very hard at all) was un-tidying my data to fit their spreadsheet model, with the x-axis variable (number of games played, in my example) as column headers.</p>

<p>After that, there were very few design decisions to be made, which (I think) is part of the allure of such a tool. Going with the <strong>Ranks</strong> (as opposed to <strong>Scores</strong>) view as default was an easy decision, since the actual win-percentage values tend to be pretty close, making things look quite cluttered.</p>

<p>The limited “possibility space”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> makes for a “beginner-friendly” visualization tool. Of course, there’s a trade-off — you can’t add another layer of labels or annotation with a <code>+</code> sign. Actually, the title in the banner for this post is “<em>after-market</em>” (read: I added it to the image outside of Flourish).</p>
<p>Anyhow, you can see the chart in the embed below, though, if you happen to be on your computer I recommend viewing it <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/30168/">here 🔗</a>, since my blog template is too narrow a view-port for a chart of this nature (IMHO).</p>

<p>Here it is as a GIF, just in case — umm, I can’t actually think of a use case, but I like GIFs. 🎦</p>

<p>All in all, Flourish is a fun tool, and definitely worth playing with yourself. Big ups to the folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/f_l_o_u_r_i_s_h">@f_l_o_u_r_i_s_h</a>, who helped me figure out how to add custom colours to my chart!</p>
