description: '`r emo::ji("memo")` Notes from my the 2018 rOpenSci unconf — Seattle edition.'
---

This year's [rOpenSci unconf](http://unconf18.ropensci.org/) was held in
Seattle, and (after the great time I had at 
[last year's event](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/06/ceci-n-est-pas-un-conf/)), 
I was thrilled to be able to go back for more! All the fun, with like 40% less 
mind-crippling impostor-syndrome anxiety.[^1] `r emo::ji("grimace")`

Once again, [Sean Kross](https://twitter.com/seankross) did a great job of rounding up [the projects](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf18-projects/), complete with emoji annotations. `r emo::ji("boom")`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "999073432494006273")
```

In order to avoid the month-long delay between attendance and blog post
from last year, I took large(ish) notes during the project presentations.
[^accessible] You can and _should_ visit the project README files for the
details (since after two days of unconferring my note-taking skills were a
little sub-par).

### Addenda

 * The very awesome Paige Bailey (aka [\@DynamicWebPaige](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige)) made a vignette on Ethical Machine Learning, but wasn't there to present. So, be sure to check that out `r emo::ji_glue(":point_down:")`.

### Thank you `r emo::ji("pray")`
 
A huge thank you to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), and everyone who
made the event happen, especially [Stefanie Butland](https://twitter.com/stefaniebutland)! 
Look at all those happy faces — what more proof could you possibly need of a 
job well done? `r emo::ji("smile")`

[^1]: At this point the fact that I'm an impostor is pretty much common knowledge, so what's there to be nervous about? `r emo::ji("wink")`
