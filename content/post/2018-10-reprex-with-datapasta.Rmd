## Scenario 1: from spreadsheet to reprex

So, you've been asked to make a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) and you want to include a bit of data that you have in a spreadsheet.[^1] Meet [**{datapasta}**](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta), a package by [Miles McBain](https://milesmcbain.xyz/) that can make your life a whole lot easier. Once you've installed datapasta, you simply copy a selected number of rows from your spreadsheet (remember, this is a _minimal_ reproducible example), and click the `Paste as tribble` option from the **DATAPASTA** section of the **Addins** dropdown.[^2]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "297922980")
```

Once you've done that, be sure to include the code in your reprex, assign a name to your data frame, and you're good to go!

## Scenario 2: from R object to pasta

Now let's say you have a data frame in R, and want to use _it_ for a reprex. Don't worry, datapasta's got you covered. You can use `datapasta::dpasta()` to render your object into the format as the result of `Paste as tribble`, above.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "297922943")
```


## Tada! `r emo::ji("tada")`


[^1]: Ideally, you would use a built-in dataset, or something so minimal you could generate it in a line or two of code (see also [reprex-cellence](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2018/06/reprexcellence/)), but that's not what's going on in this scenario. `r emo::ji("wink")`  
[^2]: There are other options for how to paste in your rectangular data, but I like the layout of `tibble::tribble()` for legibility.
