Hi! It's me, Mara (which I assume was readily apparent).

There are many things I'm good at, but writing about myself is _not_ one of them. `r emo::ji_glue(":confused:")`

Fortunately, the wild and wonderful internet lets me punt the question...

Twitter, [\@dataandme](https://twitter.com/dataandme), is probably the best place to go if you're looking to get info straight from the source (me). There's also that handy little sidebar with links to other sites.

`r emo::ji("detective")` Not sure it's really _the_ Mara Averick? Take a gander at my [keybase](https://keybase.io/maraaverick) page to put your mind at ease.
